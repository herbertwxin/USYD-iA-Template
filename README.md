# USYD-iA-Template
An iA Presenter template for the University of Sydney, I think it's a nice way to produce visually pleasing yet quick to prepare lecture/tutorial slides for math-light courses using iA Presenter. This theme follows the color outlined in the official powerpoint template.

## How to use
Place the folder "University of Sydney" into the iA presenter's theme folder, and select it in design menu, done!

## Known Problem
1. Light/dark theme inverted, dark theme is acutally the dark, while light is dark. The default theme is dark, which is visually light theme.

## Roadmap
1. Fix the light/dark theme inversion
2. Create a dark theme
